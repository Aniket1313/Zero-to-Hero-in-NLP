    "<span style=\"color:red\">English words are often seperated by whitespaces, but it's not always the case. For example, 'New York' & 'rock 'n' roll' shall be treated as single large words rather than splitting on *New* & *York*. A good reason to not rely on python's split() method for tokenization</style></span>"
